  Components have many specific attributes which are called props in React and can be of any type.

  Sometimes you need a way to validate these props. You don't want users have the freedom to input anything into your
  components.

  React has a solution for this and it's called PropTypes.

  <div id="example"></div>
  <script type="text/babel">

    class MyTitle extends React.Component {
      static propTypes = {
        title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
      }

      constructor(props) {
        super(props)
      }
      static defaultProps = {
        title: 'Hello World',
      }

      render() {
        return <h1> {this.props.title} </h1>;
      }
    }

    ReactDOM.render(
      <MyTitle />,
      document.getElementById('example')
    );
  </script>
</body>
